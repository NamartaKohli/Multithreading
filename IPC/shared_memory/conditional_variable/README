In this example we have created 2 process - 
first_process.c - 
	1. It will create  2 shared memory section one for shared data and another for shared mutex and conditional variable
	2. it will map the both shared memory region
	3. it will write the data on shared memory and signal to another process to read the data

Second_process.c - 
	1. this process will open the already created shared memory section.
	2. map both shared memory to its address space
	3. it will check the status, if data is avilable this process will read the data and signal to first process to write more data.
